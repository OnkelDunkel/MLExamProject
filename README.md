The dataset was originally dowloaded from Kaggle at above link but by some reason the dataset has now been deleted from the website. Our download of the original dataset is stored in "*employee_review.csv*".

Before working with the data we had to do some heavy data preparation so we seperated this code into its own notebook: "*Data preprocessing.ipynb*". The result of this data preparation is stored in "*all_processed.csv*".
